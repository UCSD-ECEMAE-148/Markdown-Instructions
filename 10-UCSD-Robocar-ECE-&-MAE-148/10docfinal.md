# Introduction 

This document was derived from the DIY RoboCar - Donkey Car Framework

Reference information can be found at
[<u>http://docs.donkeycar.com</u>](http://docs.donkeycar.com)

At UC San Diego’s Introduction to Autonomous Vehicles class (ECE
MAE148), we use an AI Framework called Donkey Car which is based on Deep
Learning / Human behavior cloning as well as we do traditional
programming using Robot Operating System (ROS2).

DonkeyCar can be seen as the “hello world” of affordable scaled
autonomous cars

We have added other features into our UCSD scale robot cars that are not
found

at the Default Donkey car build such as a wireless emergency off switch.
Therefore, please follow

the instructions found in this document vs. the default Donkey built.

Another framework we use called UCSD Robocar is primarily maintained and
developed by Dominic Nightingale right here at UC San Diego. UCSD
Robocar uses ROS and ROS2 for controlling our scaled robot cars which
can vary from traditional programming or machine learning to achieve an
objective. The framework works with a vast selection of sensors and
actuation methods in our inventory making it a robust framework to use
across various platforms. Has been tested on 1/16, 1/10, 1/5 scaled
robot cars and soon our go-karts.

As August 2019 we transitioned from the single board computer (SBC)
called Raspberry PI to the

Nvidia Jetson Nano. If you are using a Raspberry PI, then search in this
document for

Raspberry PI (RPI or PI) Configuration.

On 28Aug19, we updated the instructions to include Raspberry PI 4B

Depending on your Single Board Computer, Jetson Xavier NX, Jetson Nano,

then follow the related instructions.

#  

# Single Board Computer (SBC) Basic Setup

We will be using the Ubuntu Linux distribution. In the class you have
access to a virtual

machine image file with Ubuntu.

We won’t install ROS2 directly into the SBC, we will be using Docker
images and containers.

You will install OpenCV from source as part of your learning on
compiling and building

software from source.

[<u>Archive location to previous JetPack
versions</u>](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/jetpack-archive)

## Editing Remotely with Jupyter Notebooks

Install Jupyter notebook on your Jetson:

| sudo apt install jupyter-notebook |
|-----------------------------------|

[<u>https://ljvmiranda921.github.io/notebook/2018/01/31/running-a-jupyter-notebook/</u>](https://ljvmiranda921.github.io/notebook/2018/01/31/running-a-jupyter-notebook/)

SSH</u>](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZNACJvKmQNnN7QNMwgqnzjrs9JDdFbiqVFHAuhgillQ/edit?usp=sharing)

# Hardware Setup 

You should consider breaking the work on building the robots per team
member:

1)  Someone could start to build OpenCV GPU accelerated in parallel
    while you build the robot. [<u>It will take several hours building
    OpenCV from
    source</u>](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HX2zmjbVsyLnliEQ8wp97Y453g5qNAYHWtFQiKQ0elA/edit?usp=sharing).
    Try to divide the work by team members …

2)  Start designing, 3D Printing, Laser Cutting the parts

As of Spring 2022, we upgraded all the ECE MAE 148 robots to use VESCs.

If you are using a regular Electronic Speed Controller (ESC) vs. a VESC
you may need to use a I2C PWM board to generate reliable PWM to the ESC
and Steering Servo, look for the PWM Controller text below.

## Jetson Nano GPIO Header PINOUT

I2C and UART pins are connected to hardware and should not be
reassigned. By default, all other pins

(except power) are assigned as GPIO. Pins labeled with other functions
are recommended functions if

using a different device tree. Here’s [<u>a spreadsheet map to
RPi</u>](https://www.jetsonhacks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Jetson-Nano-GPIO-mapping.xlsx)
to help.

<img src="./10imagesfinal/media/image3.png"
style="width:2.83477in;height:5.24479in" />

sudo usermod -aG i2c jetson

sudo reboot now

## VESC

VESC is a super cool Electronic Speed Controller (ESC) that runs open
source code with

significantly more capabilities than a regular RC Car ESC.

VESCs are very popular for electrical skateboards, DIY electrical
scooters, and robotics.

For robotics, one of the capabilities we will use the most is Odometry
(speed and position)

based on the sensors on brushless motors (sensored) or to some extent,
specially using the latest VESCs and firmware, it is also available with
brushless motors without sensors (sensorless).

## Logitech F710 controller 

Place your Logitech F710 controller on the <span class="mark">x
mode</span>

(look for small switch in one of the controller face)

Connect the USB JoyStick Dongle into the JTN and then list the input
devices again

ls /dev/input

We are looking for a js0

### Other JoyStick Controllers

JoyStick Controllers - either the Logitech F-10 or PS4

Make sure your myconfig.py on your car directory reflects your
controller

**At the SBC**

Connecting the LogiTech Controller is as easy as plugging in the USB
dongle at the SBC.

Or if you have a PS4 controller

Connecting a PS4 Controller - Bluetooth

Deactivate the virtual environment if you are using one

deactivate

sudo apt-get install bluetooth libbluetooth3 libusb-dev

> it will disable the PWM signals and the UCSDRoboCar will stop.
>
> Think why one needs a separate EMO circuit vs. relying on the

> and driving DC motor by the electronics speed controller)
>
> First search on the web and read the datasheet of the emergency stop
> switch (EMO) components provided with the robot kit and discuss with
> your teammates how the EMO will work. You got two main components to
> build the WireLess EMO switch:

1)  A Wireless Relay with wireless remote controls

2)  A Red/Blue high power LED. This is to help the user know if the car
    is disable (Red) or Enabled (Blue).

> Do some discussion with your Team and pay attention to the Lecture
> explanations:

- What is the disable pin of the PWM controller?

- Does it disable logic 1 or 0?

- How to wire the wireless relay to provide the logic you need to
  disable the PWM controller? (1 or 0)

- What pin at the Single Board Computer (SBC) can provide the logic you
  need to disable the PWM controller

- How to connect the LEDs (Blue and Red) to indicate (BLUE - enabled),
  (RED - power is on / robot is disabled).

- What is the fail safe situation, using the normally closed or normally
  open pins of the wireless relay to disable the PWM controller?

- Note: The power to the PWM controller, that powers the LEDs, comes
  from ESC (Electronics Speed Controller). Therefore, you have to
  connect the robot batteries to the ESC and the ESC to the PWM
  controller. **We are using channel 2 for the ESC**. **Channel 1 for
  the Steering. Then you need to power the ESC for the circuit to work
  ...**

We want to have control over the versions of each software library to
minimize the framework from

breaking after system-wide upgrades. Therefore, lets create a virtual
environment for the

DonkeyCar.

### Create a virtual environment for the DonkeyCar AI Framework. 

If you want the virtual environment to be under the user’s home
directory, make sure to be on the

home directory for user jetson

If you have not done so, lets create a directory to store our projects
and one subdirectory

to store virtual environments

cd ~

mkdir projects

cd projects

mkdir envs

cd envs

pip3 install virtualenv

> if complains about user permission
>
> pip3 install virtualenv --user

We will create a virtual environment called donkey since our AI
framework is

based on the Donkey Car project

Since your SBC will be initially dedicated to the class AI framework
(Donkey), at least until

your custom project starts, let’s activate the donkey virtual env
automatically every time the user

Jetson logs into the SBC. We can remove this settings later if needed
when using ROS2

echo "source ~/projects/envs/donkey/bin/activate" \>\> ~/.bashrc

source ~/.bashrc

When a virtual environment is active, you should see
(name_of_virtual_enviroment) in front of the terminal prompt.

ex:

<span class="mark">(donkey)</span> jetson@ucsdrobocar-xxx-yy:~\$

At this point, using pip and pip3 should be the same as using pip3 by
default in this virtual environment.

\# We won't use Python2, but just in case one will need it for some
reason

python2 -c 'import cv2 as cv; print(cv.\_\_version\_\_)'

We are not done installing software yet. We need to install more
dependencies..

**Make sure you have the donkey virtual environment activated**

Remember some of these installs may take a while. It does not mean that
the SBC is frozen, you

can see that the CPU is busy with top, htop, or jtop

### Tensorflow

Now let's install [<u>Tensorflow</u>](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
(Artificial Neural Network software).

> “TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine
> learning. It has a comprehensive, flexible ecosystem of tools,
> libraries and community resources that lets researchers push the
> state-of-the-art in ML and developers easily build and deploy ML
> powered applications.”

Lets install Tensorflow enabled for GPU acceleration

[<u>https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/frameworks/install-tf-jetson-platform/index.html</u>](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/frameworks/install-tf-jetson-platform/index.html)

Remember you are using a low power SBC, depending on the size of the
software it takes a while

We are installing Tensorflow outside the virtual environment so it is
available for other uses

Here is another chance for you to study while software is being
installed…

[<u>Background information
here</u>](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/frameworks/install-tf-jetson-platform/index.html)

We are using JetPack 4.5 because the new DonkeyCar release was breaking
the install with JetPack4.6.2. It requires Python 7 and newer.

Let's stick with JetPack4.5 for now

### Modifying Camera 

Change the camera type to MOCK to enable us to test the system without a
camera

nano myconfig.py

\#CAMERA

CAMERA_TYPE = "MOCK" (PICAM\|WEBCAM\|CVCAM\|CSIC\|V4L\|MOCK)

\# if you have USB camera connected to the JTN , use WEBCAM

\# And change this line so the Donkey can run using the web interface

USE_JOYSTICK_AS_DEFAULT = False

In summary you change these 3 lines in the myconfig.py to be able to
test your Donkey installation

\# if using the PWM board the PWM board and ESC vs. VESC

> PCA9685_I2C_BUSNUM = 1

CAMERA_TYPE = "MOCK"

USE_JOYSTICK_AS_DEFAULT = False

###  

### Quick Test

Lets test the Donkey AI framework install

python manage.py drive

python manage.py drive

ex

> Starting vehicle...

>
> E-Stop!!!
>
> recorded 10 records
>
> recorded 20 records
>
> recorded 30 records
>
> recorded 40 records
>
> recorded 50 records

The Right Joystick is the Throttle, the Left Joystick is the Steering

The Y Button deletes 5s of driving at the default configuration =100
records at 20 Hz

The A Button is the emergency break

Joystick Controls:

> +------------------+---------------------------+

> \| right_stick_vert \| set_throttle \|
>
> +------------------+---------------------------+

If your joystick is not returning to neutral

You can add a deadzone value

on myconfig.py

ex:

> NETWORK_JS_SERVER_IP = "192.168.0.1"when listening for network
> joystick cont\$

> JOYSTICK_THROTTLE_DIR = -1.0 use -1.0 to flip forward/backward, use \$

Lets Integrate the JTN and PWM Controller into the RC Chassis

Charge your LiPo Battery

After you charge your Lithium Polymer (LiPo) battery(ries) - [<u>some
info here</u>](https://rogershobbycenter.com/lipoguide/)

Connect the battery(ries) **and batteries monitor/alarm**

Please do not use the batteries without the batteries monitor/alarms

**If you discharge a LiPO batteries below a threshold lets say 3.0**

#  

## Calibration of the Throttle and Steering

Before you develop code or you can use someone's code to control a
robot, we need to calibrate the actuator/mechanism to find out its range
of motion compared to the control / command a computer will send to the
controller of the actuator/mechanism.

The calibration is car specific. If you use the same platform, the
numbers should be really close. Otherwise, you will need to calibrate
your car.

<span class="mark">MAKE SURE THE ROBOT IS ON THE RC CAR STAND</span>

<span class="mark">MAKE SURE THE ROBOT IS ON THE RC CAR STAND</span>

<span class="mark">MAKE SURE THE ROBOT IS ON THE RC CAR STAND</span>

<span class="mark">MAKE SURE THE ROBOT IS ON THE RC CAR STAND</span>

<span class="mark">MAKE SURE THE ROBOT IS ON THE RC CAR STAND</span>

Follow the safety guidelines provided in person in the class.

If something does not sound right, don’t do it. Safety first.

Power the JTN

Power the Electronic Speed Controller (ESC)

Lets run a Python command to calibrate Steering and Throttle

The donkey commands need to be run from the directory you created for
your car, i.e., ~/projects/<span class="mark">d4</span>

If you have not done so, SSH into the JTN

If needed, change directory to d4

cd ~/projects/d4

##  

### Begin Calibration

donkey calibrate <span class="mark">--channel 1</span> --bus 1

**Please make sure that when you are trying the steering values you do
not keep the steering**

**servo max out**.

Please reduce go back 10 or 15 values when you notice the servo motor is
not moving or making a

constant noise. If you leave the servo motor max-out you will most
likely burn it.

**If by any chance your software locks-up, please turn off the ESC
immediately.**

Then once you run the calibrate again, issue the center value before
turning in the ESC again

Note that after 10 values or so the calibration may time out. Just run
it again.

Try some values around 390 to center the steering

> Enter a PWM setting to test(100-600)370
>
> Enter a PWM setting to test(100-600)380
>
> Enter a PWM setting to test(100-600)390
>
> Enter a PWM setting to test(100-600)400

<span class="mark">In my case</span>, 390 seems to center the steering

Take note of the left max and right max value. We will be able to adjust
these after we try driving the

car so it goes straight.

ex:

390 - Center

<span class="mark">290</span> - Steering left max

<span class="mark">490</span> - Steering right max

Note: If the donkey calibration times-out, just run it again.

You can end the calibration by typing CTRL-C

<span class="mark">MAKE SURE THE ROBOT IS ON THE RC CAR STAND</span>

<span class="mark">MAKE SURE THE ROBOT IS ON THE RC CAR STAND</span>

<span class="mark">MAKE SURE THE ROBOT IS ON THE RC CAR STAND</span>

<span class="mark">MAKE SURE THE ROBOT IS ON THE RC CAR STAND</span>

<span class="mark">MAKE SURE THE ROBOT IS ON THE RC CAR STAND</span>

Now to calibrate the Throttle Electronic Speed Controller ESC (THROTTLE)

Following the standard for R/C cars. Throttle goes on channel
<span class="mark">2</span>

donkey calibrate <span class="mark">--channel 2 --bus 1</span>

> Enter a PWM setting to test(100-600)370
>
> Enter a PWM setting to test(100-600)<span class="mark">380</span>
> (neutral)
>
> Enter a PWM setting to test(100-600)390

On my case, 380 when I power up the ESC seems to be the middle point
(neutral),

I will use 380. Your case may vaires. 370 seems a common value

Neutral when power the ESC - <span class="mark">380</span>

<span class="mark">Make sure the car is balanced over the car
stand</span>

Then go in increments of 10 until you can no longer hear an increase on
the speed

of the car. Don’t worry much about the max speed since we won’t drive
that fast autonomously

and during training the speed will be limited.

Max speed forward - <span class="mark">490</span>

Reverse on RC cars is a little tricky because the ESC needs to receive

a reverse pulse, zero pulse, and again reverse pulse to start to go
backwards.

Use the same technique as above set the PWM setting to your zero
throttle

(lets say 380 or 370).

I got for Throttle

<span class="mark">490</span> - Max speed forward

<span class="mark">380</span> - Neutral

<span class="mark">300</span> - Max speed backwards

---

For my robocar I have:

Steering

<span class="mark">290</span> - Steering left max

<span class="mark">490</span> - Steering right max

Throttle

<span class="mark">490</span> - Max speed forward

<span class="mark">380</span> - Neutral

<span class="mark">300</span> - Max speed backwards

### Saving car configuration file

Now let's write these values into the car configuration file

Edit the file my config.py

nano myconfig.py

Change these values according to YOUR <span class="mark">calibration
values</span> and <span class="mark">where you have the Steering Servo
and ESC</span> connected

...

STEERING

STEERING_CHANNEL = 1 channel on the 9685 pwm board 0-15

STEERING_LEFT_PWM = 290 pwm value for full left steering

STEERING_RIGHT_PWM = 490 pwm value for full right steering

THROTTLE

THROTTLE_CHANNEL = 2 channel on the 9685 pwm board 0-15

THROTTLE_FORWARD_PWM = 490 pwm value for max forward throttle

THROTTLE_STOPPED_PWM = 380 pwm value for no movement

THROTTLE_REVERSE_PWM = 300 pwm value for max reverse throttle

Also, change these

CAMERA

CAMERA_TYPE = "WEBCAM" (PICAM\|WEBCAM\|CVCAM\|CSIC\|V4L\|MOCK)

9865, overrides only if needed, ie. TX2..

PCA9685_I2C_ADDR = 0x40 I2C address, use i2cdetect to validate this
numb\$

PCA9685_I2C_BUSNUM = 1 None will auto detect, which is fine on the pi.
\$

JOYSTICK

USE_JOYSTICK_AS_DEFAULT = True when starting the manage.py, when True,
wil\$

and if needed to zero the joystick

JOYSTICK_DEADZONE = 0.01 when non zero, this is the smallest thro\$

Note: When driving the robot, if you robot has too much power or not
enough power

you can adjust the max_throttle

JOYSTICK_MAX_THROTTLE = 0.5

This also will be your starting power setting when using the constant
throttle autopilot.

You can test driving your robot by issuing

python manage.py drive

# If you are using the VESC and OAKD camera on the physical car

## VESC

Ensure that you have already configured the VESC device using the VESC
Tool Software

Edit the myconfig.py to have these values

DRIVE_TRAIN_TYPE = "VESC"

VESC_MAX_SPEED_PERCENT =.2 \## Max speed as a percent of actual max
speed

VESC_SERIAL_PORT= "/dev/ttyACM0" \## check this val with ls /dev/tty\*

VESC_HAS_SENSOR= True

VESC_START_HEARTBEAT= True

VESC_BAUDRATE= 115200

VESC_TIMEOUT= 0.05

VESC_STEERING_SCALE = .5

VESC_STEERING_OFFSET = .5

DONKEY_GYM = False

(we will leave the CAMERA_TYPE = “MOCK” for now to make sure we can
drive the car with the VESC)

And replace them on the Jetson in the locations shown in the images
below. Note - to get the files on the jetson you can use SFTP (secure
file transfer protocol):

Examples on how to use SFTP:  
sftp jetson@ucsdrobocar-148-xx.local

cd To the directory you want to go to

put /File/Path/On/Your/Computer

alternatively

get filename /File/Location/You/Want/Them/Go/On/Your/Computer

To get a directory

get -rf filename /File/Location/You/Want/Them/Go/On/Your/Computer

type "exit" to disconnect

## <img src="./10imagesfinal/media/image18.png"
style="width:4.35161in;height:3.27604in" /><img src="./10imagesfinal/media/image24.png"
style="width:4.30729in;height:3.13152in" />

Once these have been replaced, you should run

python manage.py drive

It should first throw a pyvesc import error. Follow the description in
the terminal to install the needed libraries

Then run it again. It should throw a permissions error. Follow the
advice on how to fix the error with chmod

Int(10) error bug fix (Credit Saimai Lau and Albert Chang):  
When running python manage.py drive, the intermittent "invalid literal
for int() with base 10: 'None' error is from the VESC package checking
whether the version of the VESC is below 3.0, so we can comment out that
part since we're using 6.0 just do

nano
/home/jetson/projects/envs/donkey/lib/python3.6/site-packages/pyvesc/VESC/VESC.py

and put \# at the beginning of lines 38-40 Then ^S to save and ^X to
exit

<img src="./10imagesfinal/media/image35.png"
style="width:7.5in;height:2.08333in" />

Error explanation: The self.get_firmware_version() get thes version by
requesting it from the VESC and reading the replied bytes, but sometimes
the data is lost or incomplete so the function returns 'None' as the
version. We already know the version is 6.0 so we don’t need this
function.

## OAKD 

Once you have the VESC driving the car, you will need to make sure you
have set up the document by following the instructions labeled
Configuring OAKD Lite found [<u>earlier in this
document</u>](#configuring-oakd-lite)

Edit the myconfig.py camera type to OAKD

CAMERA_TYPE = "OAKD"

Make sure the camera is working by checking the images that are being
saved to the /data/images directory.

The easiest way to do this is to go to

[<u>http://localhost:8887</u>](http://localhost:8887) while running
donkeysim, and you should be able to see a livestream from the camera.
Note - if several people are running donkeysim at the same time on the
same wifi this interface may get buggy

You can also do this by either:

transferring the files to you laptop or virtual machine

with scp, rsync, winscp (windows) or filezilla (mac)

Or

Using NoMachine by following the instructions found
[<u>here</u>](#remote-desktop-installation) in this document

## GNSS Configuration:

## How to Plug PointOneNav to Donkeycar

1.  Make sure your user is added to the dialout group. If not

    1.  sudo adduser jetson dialout

    2.  sudo reboot now

2.  Download
    [<u>https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BK_UjH-He9d_D4eObWMHzpHHCqmtq75h/view?usp=share_link</u>](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BK_UjH-He9d_D4eObWMHzpHHCqmtq75h/view?usp=share_link)
    (Note that this zip file cannot be shared outside of the class. It
    is still proprietary as of now)

3.  Unzip.

4.  Run

    1.  cd quectel-lg69t-am.0.15.0/p1_runner

    2.  deactivate (This should get you out of the current environment)

    3.  wget
        https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/latest/download/Mambaforge-pypy3-Linux-aarch64.sh
        .

    4.  bash Mambaforge-pypy3-Linux-aarch64.sh

    5.  Reboot the jetson

    6.  mamba create --name py37 -c conda-forge python=3.7 pip

    7.  mamba activate py37

    8.  <span class="mark">pip3 install -e .</span>

        1.  %If this fails, you can try just going to the p1_runner
            directory and running the python3 bin/config_tool.py
            command, and then doing “pip install \_\_\_\_” for all the
            missing things, you may just need

            1.  pip install pyserial

            2.  pip install fusion_engine_client

            3.  pip install pynmea

            4.  pip install ntripstreams

            5.  pip install websockets

    9.  python3 bin/config_tool.py reset factory

    10. python3 bin/config_tool.py apply uart2_message_rate nmea gga on

    11. python3 bin/config_tool.py save

    12. python3 bin/runner.py --device-id \<polaris_username\> --polaris
        \<polaris_password\> --device-port /dev/ttyUSB1

> (if not getting any data including Nans try USB0)

Note: The GPS corrections will only happen when you are actively running
runner.py. I recommend making a bashrc command that you can run to start
up the runner.py program easily in a 2nd terminal while using the GPS
for anything.

5.  Create a project with the DonkeyCar path follow template

    1.  Open a new terminal window

    2.  Make sure that the donkey car environment is running

        1.  source ~/projects/envs/donkey/bin/activate

    3.  cd ~/projects

    4.  donkey createcar --path ./mycar --template path_follow

6.  Set the following in the myconfig.py

    1.  GPS_SERIAL = “/dev/ttyUSB2” (USB1 if USB0 used above)

    2.  GPS_SERIAL_BAUDRATE = 460800

    3.  GPS_DEBUG = True

    4.  HAVE_GPS = True

    5.  GPS_NMEA_PATH = None

7.  Also set things like the VESC parameters in myconfig.py. You can
    copy these over from the donkeycar you created earlier.

8.  Run

    1.  python3 manage.py drive

9.  You should see GPS positions being outputted after you run
    Donkeycar. If you don’t want to output set GPS_DEBUG to False

10. Configure button actions

    1.  SAVE_PATH_BTN is the button to save the in-memory path to a
        file.

    2.  LOAD_PATH_BTN is the button to (re)load path from the csv file
        into memory.

    3.  RESET_ORIGIN_BTN is the button to set the current position as
        the origin.

    4.  ERASE_PATH_BTN is the button to erase path from memory and reset
        the origin.

    5.  TOGGLE_RECORDING_BTN is the button to toggle recording mode on
        or off. Note that there is a pre-assigned button in the web ui,
        so there is not need to assign this button to one of the web/w\*
        buttons if you are using the web ui.

    6.  INC_PID_D_BTN is the button to change PID 'D' constant by
        PID_D_DELTA.

    7.  DEC_PID_D_BTN is the button to change PID 'D' constant by
        -PID_D_DELTA

    8.  INC_PID_P_BTN is the button to change PID 'P' constant by
        PID_P_DELTA

    9.  DEC_PID_P_BTN is the button to change PID 'P' constant by
        -PID_P_DELTA

11. Recording a path

    1.  The algorithm assumes we will be driving in a continuous
        connected path such that the start and end are the same. You can
        adjust the space between recorded waypoints by editing the
        PATH_MIN_DIST value in myconfig.py You can change the name and
        location of the saved file by editing the PATH_FILENAME value.

    2.  Enter User driving mode using either the web controller or a
        game controller.

    3.  Move the car to the desired starting point

    4.  Erase the path in memory (which will also reset the origin).

        1.  Make sure to reset the origin!!! If you didn’t need to erase
            the path in memory you can just

    5.  Toggle recording on.

    6.  Drive the car manually around the track until you reach the
        desired starting point again.

    7.  Toggle recording off.

    8.  If desired, save the path.

12. Following a path

    1.  Enter User driving mode using either the web controller or a
        game controller.

    2.  Move the car to the desired starting point - make sure it’s the
        same one from when you recorded the path

    3.  Reset the origin (be careful; don't erase the path, just reset
        the origin).

    4.  Load the path

    5.  Enter Autosteering or Autopilot driving mode. This is normally
        done by pressing the start button either once or twice If you
        are in Autosteering mode you will need to manually provide
        throttle for the car to move. If you are in Autopilot mode the
        car should drive itself completely.

13. Configuring Path Follow Parameters

    1.  So the algorithm uses the cross-track error between a desired
        line and the vehicle's measured position to decide how much and
        which way to steer. But the path we recorded is not a simple
        line; it is a lot of points that is typically some kind of
        circuit. As described above, we use the vehicle's current
        position to choose a short segment of the path that we use as
        our desired track. That short segment is recalculated every time
        we get a new measured car position. There are a few
        configuration parameters that determine exactly which two points
        on the path that we use to calculate the desired track line.

        1.  PATH_SEARCH_LENGTH = None \# number of points to search for
            closest point, None to search entire path

        2.  PATH_LOOK_AHEAD = 1 \# number of points ahead of the closest
            point to include in cte track

        3.  PATH_LOOK_BEHIND = 1 \# number of points behind the closest
            point to include in cte track

    2.  Generally, if you are driving very fast you might want the look
        ahead to be larger than if driving slowly so that your steering
        can anticipate upcoming curves. Increasing the length of the
        resulting track line, by increasing the look behind and/or look
        ahead, also acts as a noise filter; it smooths out the track.
        This reduces the amount of jitter in the controller. However,
        this must be balanced with the true curves in the path; longer
        track segments effectively 'flatten' curves and so can result in
        understeer; not steering enough when on a curve.

14. Determining PID Coefficients

    1.  The PID coefficients are the most important (and time consuming)
        parameters to configure. If they are not correct for your car
        then it will not follow the path. The coefficients can be
        changed by editing their values in the myconfig.py file.

    2.  PID_P is the proportional coefficient; it is multiplied with the
        cross-track error. This is the most important parameter; it
        contributes the most to the output steering value and in some
        cases may be all that is needed to follow the line. If this is
        too small then car will not turn enough when it reaches a curve.
        If this to too large then it will over-react to small changes in
        the path and may start turning in circles; especially when it
        gets to a curve.

    3.  PID_D is the differential coefficient; it is multiplied with the
        change in the cross-track error. This parameter can be useful in
        reducing oscillations and overshoot.

    4.  PID_I is the integral coefficient; it is multiplied with the
        total accumulated cross-track error. This may be useful in
        reducing offsets caused by accumulated error; such as if one
        wheel is slightly smaller in diameter than another.

    5.  Determining PID Coefficients can be difficult. One approach is:

        1.  First determine the P coefficient.

        2.  zero out the D and the I coefficients.

        3.  Use a kind of 'binary' search to find a value where the
            vehicle will roughly follow a recorded straight line;
            probably oscillating around it. It will be weaving

        4.  Next find a D coefficient that reduces the weaving
            (oscillations) on a straight line. Then record a path with a
            tight turn. Find a D coefficient that reduces the overshoot
            when turning.

        5.  You may not even need the I value. If the car becomes
            unstable after driving for a while then you may want to
            start to set this value. It will likely be much smaller than
            the other values.

        6.  Be patient. Start with a reasonably slow speed. Change one
            thing at a time and test the change; don't make many changes
            at once. Write down what is working.

        7.  Once you have a stable PID controller, then you can figure
            out just how fast you can go with it before autopilot
            becomes unstable. If you want to go faster then set the
            desired speed and start tweaking the values again using the
            method suggested above.

# Backup of the uSD Card

Once you finished the configuration of your SBC, why not making another
backup of the uSD card

(or first one if you have not done it yet)

It can save you lots of time during a recovery process. In case of a
crash, you will only need to

restore the image vs. install all over again.

Backup the uSD card following these steps in a Linux machine

Eject the uSD card from your SBC, plug it into a linux PC using a uSD
adapter

On my case, the 64G uSD was mounted on /dev/sda

example on the command line for making an image of the uSD card mounted

on a Linux machines as /dev/sda

sudo dd bs=4M if=/dev/sda of=ucsd_robocar_image_25sep19.img

Lets compress the image using Zip

zip ucsd_robocar_image_25sep19.zip ucsd_robocar_image_25sep19.img

## If needed, we have an JTN uSD Card Image Ready for Plug and Play

If you run out of time trying to make the compilation and build OpenCV,
and install the Donkey AI

framework, here is a link for a 64G Bytes uSDcard that is ready to go.
[<u>Get recovery</u> <u>image
here</u>](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1J8_rFLjNtM5CBymwTAi_3IYsQ7VI9Rd6/view?usp=sharing).
<span class="mark"></span>

The recovery image already has all the software installed.

Connect a uUSB cable between the PC and the JTN, or connect the JTN to
the access point

using a network cable.

Boot the JTN, wait 1~2 minutes for the software to finish loading

You can ssh to the JTN

ssh jetson@192.168.55.1

or

ssh jetson@ucsdrobocar-xxx-yy.local

enter password

jetsonucsd

You need to change the host name and change the default password

Connect the JTN to a WiFi network

see steps earlier in this document

ex:

sudo nmcli device wifi connect UCSDRoboCar5GHz password UCSDrobocars2018

shutdown the JTN

sudo shutdown now

If you are using the uUSB cable, remove it from the JTN

Power on the JTN with the provided 5V power supply

Wait 1~2 minutes for the JTN to complete the boot process

Then use SSH to connect to the JTN

PCA9685_I2C_BUSNUM = 1 None will auto detect, which is fine on the pi.
But other platforms should specify the bus number.

STEERING_CHANNEL = 1 channel on the 9685 pwm board 0-15

STEERING_LEFT_PWM = 290 pwm value for full left steering

STEERING_RIGHT_PWM = 490 pwm value for full right steering

THROTTLE_CHANNEL = 2 channel on the 9685 pwm board 0-15

THROTTLE_FORWARD_PWM = 490 pwm value for max forward throttle

THROTTLE_STOPPED_PWM = 380 pwm value for no movement

THROTTLE_REVERSE_PWM = 300 pwm value for max reverse throttle

USE_JOYSTICK_AS_DEFAULT = True when starting the manage.py, when True,
will not require a --js option to use the joystick

CONTROLLER_TYPE='F710' (ps3\|ps4\|xbox\|nimbus\|wiiu\|F710)

JOYSTICK_DEADZONE = 0.01 when non zero, this is the smallest throttle

Installing TensorRT on Ubuntu18.04

After installing Tensorflow on your virtual environment

ex: conda install tensorflow-gpu==1.13.1

Testing the Tensorflow Install

python

Enter the following txt, you can cut and paste

Python

import tensorflow as tf

hello = tf.constant('Hello, TensorFlow!')

sess = tf.Session()

print(sess.run(hello))

[<u>https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/sdk/tensorrt-install-guide/index.htmlinstalling-tar</u>](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/sdk/tensorrt-install-guide/index.html#installing-tar)

[<u>https://developer.nvidia.com/nvidia-tensorrt-5x-download</u>](https://developer.nvidia.com/nvidia-tensorrt-5x-download)

<img src="./10imagesfinal/media/image14.png"
style="width:3.57813in;height:0.36723in" />

Open a terminal window and navigate to the directory where you saved the
file

Now let’s expand the file

<img src="./10imagesfinal/media/image16.png"
style="width:6.875in;height:0.44444in" />

Note that the file above expects to work with cudnn7.5

The Cuda install will need to match that version, cudnn7.5

e.g. ~/projects/TensorRT-5.1.5.0/

cd ~/projects/TensorRT-5.1.5.0

tar xzvf
TensorRT-5.1.5.0.Ubuntu-18.04.2.x86_64-gnu.cuda-10.1.<span class="mark">cudnn7.5</span>.tar.gz

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=\$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:~/projects/TensorRT-5.1.5.0/lib

Activate the virtual environment you want TensorflowRT installed

e.g. source ~/projects/env/bin/activate

cd python

If using python 3.6

pip install tensorrt-5.1.5.0-cp36-none-linux_x86_64.whl

or if using python3.7

pip install tensorrt-5.1.5.0-cp37-none-linux_x86_64.whl

cd ..

cd uff

pip install uff-0.6.3-py2.py3-none-any.whl

which convert-to-uff

> /home/jack/projects/env/bin/convert-to-uff

or

which convert-to-uff

> /home/jack/miniconda3/envs/donkey/bin/convert-to-uff

cd ..

cd graphsurgeon

pip install graphsurgeon-0.4.1-py2.py3-none-any.whl

cd..

apt-get install tree

tree -d

dpkg -l \| grep nvinfer

Testing TensorRT

python

import tensorrt as trt

exit()

Example after training a model

You end up with a Linear.h5 in the models folder

python manage.py train --model=./models/Linear.h5
--tub=./data/tub_1_19-06-29,...

Freeze model using freeze_model.py in donkeycar/scripts

The frozen model is stored as protocol buffers.

This command also exports some metadata about the model which is saved
in ./models/Linear.metadata

python freeze_model.py --model=./models/Linear.h5
--output=./models/Linear.pb

Convert the frozen model to UFF. The command below creates a file
./models/Linear.uff

convert-to-uff ./models/Linear.pb

> cd ~/projects/d3_trax_rally
>
> python ~/projects/donkeycar/scripts/freeze_model.py
> --model=./models/24aug19_ucsd_booker_linear_1_320_240.h5
> --output=./models/24aug19_ucsd_booker_linear_1_320_240.pb
>
> convert-to-uff ./models/24aug19_ucsd_booker_linear_1_320_240.pb

For the RPI

If you would like to try tflite support, you will need a newer version
of Tensorflow on the pi. You can download and install this version:

wget
[https://tawn-train.s3.amazonaws.com/tf/tensorflow-2.0.0a0-cp35-cp35m-linux_armv7l.whl](https://slack-redir.net/link?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftawn-train.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ftf%2Ftensorflow-2.0.0a0-cp35-cp35m-linux_armv7l.whl)

pip install tensorflow-2.0.0a0-cp35-cp35m-linux_armv7l.whl

Your host PC can stay at TF 1.13.1

to train a TensorRT model, during training add the arg

--type=tensorrt_linear

And for TFlite support add the arg

--type=tflite_linear

Also use this flag when running your model on the car. (edited)

PS3 Controller Modes

This is similar for the Logitech wireless controllers

The default mode will be that <span class="mark">User</span> is in
Control. That is, the user controls Steering and Throttle.

To switch to **<span class="mark">Local Angle</span>** (software
controls the Steering and uses the Throttle), you need to press the
**\<Select\>** button in the Joystick.

If you give Throttle the Robocar should drive around semi-autonomously.

After few laps that you see that your model is good,

<span class="mark">Please hold your robot with the wheels out of the
floor</span>

you can press the **\<Start\>** button <span class="mark">and
immediately press **the \<left_DOWN_arrow\>** button a few times to
decrease the Throttle as needed.</span> This is important so you slow
down the Robocar for a constant Throttle.

Press the \<left_UP_arrow\> to give it more Throttle as needed.

Pressing \<<span class="mark">X\></span> will stop the robocar and go
back to User mode (user is in control)

You can change the driving modes by pressing the **\<Select\>** button.
You should be able to see a message on your computer terminal that is
SSH connected to the RoboCar RPI.

The Local & Angle mode (fully autonomous) is to be used after you see
that you can do few laps with local angle

> Hit the Select button to toggle between three modes - User, Local
> Angle, and Local Throttle & Angle.

- User - User controls both steering and throttle with joystick

- Local Angle - Ai controls steering. User controls the throttle.

- Local Throttle & Angle - Ai controls both steering and throttle

> When the car is in Local Angle mode, the NN will steer. You must
> provide throttle...

Ideally you will have ~ 60 laps

If you don’t have a good working Auto-Pilot, get more data in 10 laps
increments.

In summary, you may want to start with 60 laps and then do 10~20 laps
more to see if the model gets better.

I would not worry much about a few bad spots when collecting data. Drive
the car back to the track,

then press Green_Triangle to delete the last 5s of data.

Keep driving, you will develop good skills, you will get good data and
better models. If you leave the track, just drive the RoboCar back to
track. It may even learn how to get back to track.

If you keep the data from the same track (ex: UCSD Track) in the
d2t/data directory, as you add more files to it (e.g.,
tub\_<span class="mark">5</span>\_17-10-13) it will help your model. At
the same time it will take more time to train since your model will read
all the data sets in the directory. You can use the transfer model to
add new data to a current model.

Incremental training using a previous model

> python train.py --tub ~/projects/d2t/data/NAME_OF_NEW_TUBE_DATA
> --transfer=models/NAME_OF_PREVIOUS_MODEL.h5
> --model=models/NAME_OF_NEW_MODEL.h5

Some Advanced Tools

The visualization tool is to be used on your PC. Please even if you can,
please do not use the GPU Cluster Resources for this.

Raspberry PI (RPI or PI) Configuration

04Nov19 - Added a link to a plug and play image

03Nov19 - Updated instruction for Tensorflow 2.0

28Aug19 - updated the instructions to include Raspberry PI 4B

08Aug19 - Since we are using the Nvidia Jetson Nano, I am no longer
maintaining the RPI

instructions. If you got to this point and is using Raspberry PIs,
please check the

Donkey Docs for the latest updates…
[<u>http://docs.donkeycar.com</u>](http://docs.donkeycar.com)

In general if you are using a Linux distribution like Ubuntu in this
course it will make

your life is much easier. Initially, you will need access to a Linux to
modify some files from

a uSD card. You can ask a colleague, TA, or course instructor for help.

Moreover, if you use Linux it will be another entry into your resume.
Give it a try. You can

make a dual boot in your computer or have a virtual machine,
[<u>VirtualBox is free</u>](https://www.virtualbox.org/).

*-------------*

We will start with an Operating System Image called Raspbian (Raspberry
Debian …)

You can use your favorite disk image writer to have the disk image
written to the uSD.

The uSD card to be used on the RPI. Note, this is not a regular file
copy operation.

You can use Etcher [<u>https://etcher.io/</u>](https://etcher.io/)

From your PC let's prepare the Raspberry PI (RPI) uSD card

Make sure your computer can access the Internet

If you are using one of our WiFi Access Points in one of the labs or at
one of the tracks, the first PC

that connects to the WiFi Access point will need to accept the UCSD
Wireless Visitor Agreement,

just like when connecting directly to UCSD’s Visitor WiFi.

Get the Raspbian Lite uSD image
[<u>here.</u>](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/)

Etcher can use Zipped files, you don’t need to Unzip the image file. If
you are using Linux command

lines to write the disk image to a uSD card you may need to extract the
file first.

This OS (disk) image is based on the Raspbian headless (no GUI). We will
use command line on

the RPI, to get to the RPI we will be using SSH (secure shell). Don’t
worry, these are just command

line names. Mastering these will be good skills to have.

If you don’t know about SSH and the command line in Linux, you will
learn enough in this course.

Let's write the disk image into the uSD Card

Connect the provided uSD adapter into your PC

Insert the provided uSD card (64 Gbytes) into the uSD adapter

Install and run Etcher [<u>https://etcher.io/</u>](https://etcher.io/)

Start Etcher, chose the Zipped file with the Disk Image you downloaded,

pay attention when choosing the drive with the uSD card on it (e.g., 64
Gbytes)

write the image to uSD card.

If you are using Linux, after you finish writing the disk image to the
uSD card

you should see two partitions in your computer file system

<span class="mark">boot and rootfs</span>

<span class="mark">If you are not seeing these partitions in your
computer, try removing the uSD card from</span>

<span class="mark">your computer then insert it again. If that does not
work, try using a</span>

<span class="mark">computer running Linux.</span>

Prepare the network configuration file.

We will create a text file with the WiFi configurations.

You can use the nano or gedit on Linux (e.g.,Ubuntu).

On other OSes make sure the file you are creating is a plain text file.

Don’t use MS Word or other Apps that may save the file with different
file formats

and hidden text format characters.

Note: If you are using a MAC with the SD to uSD adapter, MAC OS may not
be able to

write the Donkey Image disk “boot”. Use the USB uSD card adapter
provider for each

Team.

At the root partition of the uSD card, will name the file as
wpa_supplicant.conf

Using Linux or a Mac terminal, the command line you will use is

sudo nano wpa_supplicant.conf

Navigate to the drive that you created the RPI image.

Look for a boot partition

Edit and save the file with this name wpa_supplicant.conf

Open a terminal ex:

cd /media/UserID/boot

ex:

cd /media/jack/boot

sudo nano wpa_supplicant.conf

or

sudo nano /media/UserID/boot/wpa_supplicant.conf

You will need to enter your password

ex: nano /media/jack/boot/wpa_supplicant.conf

on a mac

cd /Volumes/boot

nano wpa_supplicant.conf

Here is the content of wpa_supplicant.conf

You can copy and paste it

ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev

update_config=1

country=US

network={

ssid="SD-DIYRoboCar5GHz"

key_mgmt=WPA-PSK

SSH into the RPI

ssh pi@ucsdrobocar-xxx-yy.local

Lets update the repository content and upgrade the raspbian

(RPI Linux OS based on Debian)

**If you did not configure the RPI WiFI correctly it will not connect
to**

**your WiFi Access Point (AP)**

**If needed**

edit the wpa_supplicant.conf file

sudo nano /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf

SSH into the RPI

ssh pi@ucsdrobocar-xxx-yy.local

Check that the date and time is correct at the RPI and instal ntp to
auto-update date and time

date

Hint. In the case the clock on the RPI is not updating automatically by
getting information

from the Internet, you need to set the date and time manually or updates
and install may fail

Here is how you can do it

ex: sudo date -s '2018-10-04 09:30:00'

Once you set the country/location, and have an active Internet access,

these should force a clock synchronization on boot/reboot

Initially it may be off because you have not set the time zone yet. e.g.
Pacific Time

sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install ntp

sudo /etc/init.d/ntp stop

sudo ntpd -q -g  
sudo /etc/init.d/ntp start

Assuming you RPI is connected to the Internet, you can always use

sudo ntpd -q -g

to get the time from a server in the Internet

Reboot to check if the date / times are updating correctly

sudo reboot now

SSH into the RPI

Check that the date and time are correct

date

Be patient, this may take a while depending on how many updates were
released

after the uSD card image that you are using

sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get upgrade

<span class="mark">then reboot the RPI</span>

<span class="mark">sudo reboot now</span>

<span class="mark">Connect to the RPI  
As applicable, once you connect to your RPI run the following
command</span>

<span class="mark">sudo raspi-config</span>

<span class="mark">to change the host name and other things.</span>

<span class="mark">On the RPI use this command</span>

<span class="mark">ex: For team 07, use hostname ucsdrobocar07</span>

<span class="mark">Change the password</span>

<span class="mark">sudo raspi-config</span>

User Password, Hostname (if needed), **enable camera, enable I2C**,

locale-time zone to America/ US Pacific / Los Angeles

WiFi country US, then expand the file system just in case

it was not automatically done at boot.

If changed the host name, your RPI will have the new hostname on

the next boot

sudo reboot now

After you configure your RPI WiFi and Hostname correctly and reboot,

Your RPI should be accessible using SSH from Linux, Mac, Windows

Open a terminal

ssh pi@ucsdrobocar-xxx-yy.local

enter your password

try this just in case you can not connect to the RPI on another WiFi
Access point

such as your Phone acting as a hotspot

ssh pi@ucsdrobocar-xxx-yy (without .local)

If you have not done so, change the default password

on the RPI

passwd

To disable downloading translations, to save time,

create a file named 99translations

sudo nano /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/99translations

Place the following line in the 99translations

Acquire::Languages "none";

reboot the RPI

sudo reboot now

Lets install some dependencies, libraries, and utilities

sudo apt-get update

This step may take some time, be patient

sudo apt-get install build-essential python3 python3-dev python3-pip
python3-virtualenv python3-numpy python3-picamera python3-pandas
python3-rpi.gpio i2c-tools avahi-utils joystick libopenjp2-7-dev
libtiff5-dev gfortran libatlas-base-dev libopenblas-dev
libhdf5-serial-dev git ntp

And install these to have the dependencies for OpenCV

sudo apt-get install libilmbase-dev libopenexr-dev libgstreamer1.0-dev
libjasper-dev libwebp-dev libatlas-base-dev libavcodec-dev
libavformat-dev libswscale-dev libqtgui4 libqt4-test

Installing OpenCV

sudo apt install python3-opencv

reboot the RPI

sudo reboot now

Lets set a virtual environment and name it donkey

We will create virtual environments to enable using different software
library configurations without  
having to install them at the root and user level (higher level)

If you have not done so, lets create a directory to store our projects
and one subdirectory

to store virtual environments

cd ~

mkdir projects

cd projects

mkdir envs

cd envs

pip3 install virtualenv

python3 -m virtualenv -p python3
~/projects/envs/<span class="mark">donkey</span> --system-site-packages

this line will activate the virtual environment called donkey every time
the

user pi logs in a terminal

echo "source ~/projects/envs/donkey/bin/activate" \>\> ~/.bashrc

source ~/.bashrc

When a virtual environment is active, you should see
(name_of_virtual_enviroment)

in front of the terminal prompt

ex:

(donkey) pi@ucsdrobocar-xxx-yy:~\$

Testing to see if OpenCV is installed in the virtual env

python

import cv2

cv2.\_\_version\_\_

exit ()

> \[GCC 8.2.0\] on linux
>
> Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.

> \>\>\> exit ()

Lets install the Donkeycar AI framework

if not done, create a directory called projects

mkdir projects

cd projects

Get the latest donkeycar from Github.

git clone https://github.com/autorope/donkeycar

cd donkeycar

git checkout master

This step may take some time, be patient

pip install -e .\[pi\]

Lets install Tensorflow

single board computer (SBC) ...

cd ~/projects

Type the command below all in one line

wget
https://github.com/PINTO0309/Tensorflow-bin/raw/master/tensorflow-2.0.0-cp37-cp37m-linux_armv7l.whl

Lets install tensorflow. This step may take some time to install. You
are using a low power

pip install --upgrade tensorflow-2.0.0-cp37-cp37m-linux_armv7l.whl

Quick test of the Tensorflow install

python -c "import tensorflow"

If no errors, you should be good.

> style="width:6.875in;height:1.86111in" />

Try the Tensorflow install again few times if it fails

If needed, upgrade pip

pip install --upgrade pip

Let’s create a car on the path ~/projects/d3

donkey createcar --path ~/projects/d3

Your RPI directory should look like this

list the content of a directory with ls

d3 donkeycar envs tensorflow-2.0.0-cp37-cp37m-linux_armv7l.whl

cd ~/projects/d3

ls

The output should be something similar to

config.py data logs manage.py models myconfig.py train.py

Research what you have to do so when you log into your RPI you are
working from

the car directory like ~/projects/d3 vs. having to issue the command cd
/projects/d3

all the time after you log into the RPI.

What happens when the RPI boots in relation to the file .bashrc (
~/.bashrc) ?

To enable the use of a WebCam (USB cameras)

sudo apt-get install python3-dev python3-numpy libsdl-dev
libsdl-image1.2-dev \\

libsdl-mixer1.2-dev libsdl-ttf2.0-dev libsmpeg-dev libportmidi-dev \\

libavformat-dev libswscale-dev libjpeg-dev libfreetype6-dev

pip install pygame

[<u>Here is a
link</u>](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1P3ssbGEQ8H6_FHivowrTTnEfmLmv-KXJ/view?usp=sharing)
to a plug an play image with necessary software installed

If you are at UCSD connected to one of the classes WiFi access points
you can

connect to the RPI with

ssh pi@ucsdrobocar-xxx-yy.local

> raspberryucsd

Then make sure to change the hostname and password. See instructions in
this document.

Installing the Pulse Width Modulation (PWM)

https://docs.google.com/document/d/11nu6_ReReoIxA1KVq-sCy7Tczbk6io0izcItucrw7hI/edit

<img src="./10imagesfinal/media/image39.png"
style="width:5.15625in;height:5.44792in" />

For reference, below is the Raspberry Pi Pinout.

You will notice we connect to +3.3v, the two I2C pins (SDA and SCL) and
ground:

<img src="./10imagesfinal/media/image29.png"
style="width:6.8125in;height:5.94792in" />

After connecting the I2C PWM Controller lets test the communication

Power the RPI, you can use the USB power adapter for this test

sudo i2cdetect -y 1

The output is something like

0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 a b c d e f

00: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --

10: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --

20: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --

30: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --

40: <span class="mark">40</span> -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --

50: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --

60: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --

70: <span class="mark">70</span> -- -- -- -- -- -- --

(dk)pi@jackrpi02:~ \$

Look for a similar result above. 40 ...70 in this case is what we are
looking for.

Now that the RPI3 is talking to the I2C PWM board we can calibrate the
Steering and Throttle.

Lets get the EMO circuit working too in case you need to use it.

For the UCSD RoboCars, an Emergency Stop Circuit is required.

COSMOS RoboCars are not required to have the EMO

After you charge your Lithium Polymer (LiPo) battery(ries) - [<u>some
info here</u>](https://rogershobbycenter.com/lipoguide/)

Connect the battery(ries) **and batteries monitor/alarm**

**<span class="mark">Please do not use the batteries without the
batteries monitor/alarms</span>**

> **If you discharge a LiPO batteries below a threshold lets say 3.2
> volts. It may not recover to be charged. That is why it is critical
> that you use the LiPo batteries alarm all the time.**

Connecting the Emergency Stop Circuit and Batteries into the Robot

For this part of your robot, you will have to do some hacking. That is
part of the class.

The instructor will discuss the principle of the circuit and how to
implement it with the component in your robot kit.

Long story short, the PWM Controller we use has a disable pin. It the
correct logic is applied to it for example Logic 1 or 0 (3.3V or 0V) it
will disable the PWM signals and the UCSDRoboCar will stop.

Think why one needs a separate EMO circuit vs. relying on the software,
operating system and computer communicating with the PWM controller that
then send PWM pulses to the actuators (steering servo and driving DC
motor by the electronics speed controller)

First search on the web and read the datasheet of the emergency stop
switch (EMO) components provided with the robot kit and discuss them
with your teammates how the EMO will work. You got two main components
to build the a WireLess EMO switch:

3)  A Wireless Relay with wireless remote controls

4)  A Red/Blue high power LED. This is to help the user know if the car
    is disable (Blue) or Enabled (Red).

- What is the disable pin the PWM controller?

- Does it disable on logic 1 or 0?

- How to wire the wireless relay to provide the logic you need to
  disable PWM controller? (1 or 0)

- How to connect the LEDs (Blue and Red) to indicate (RED -
  hot/enabled), (BLUE - power is on / disabled).

- Note: The power to the PWM controller, that powers the LEDs, comes
  from ESC (Electronics Speed Controller). Therefore, you have to
  connect the robot batteries to the ESC and the ESC to the PWM
  controller. **We are using channel 2 for the ESC**. **Channel 1 for
  the Steering.**

After you see that the EMO is working, i.e. wireless remote control
disable the PWM, and the LEDs light up as planned, then you need to
document your work. Please use a schematic software such as Fritzing
([<u>http://fritzing.org/home/</u>](http://fritzing.org/home/)) to
document your electrical schematic.

It may seem we did the opposite way; document after your build. In our
case, you learned by looking at components information, thinking about
the logic, and experimenting. Since you are an engineer you need to
document even it if was a hack…

Working in a company you may do fast prototyping first then document. On
larger projects you make schematics, diagrams, drawings, work
instructions, then build it. Keep that in mind!

Calibration of the Throttle and Steering

Before you develop code or you can use a someone's code to control a
robot, we need to calibrate the actuator/mechanism to find out its range
of motion compared to the control / command a computer will send to the
controller of the actuator/mechanism.

The calibration is car specific. If you use the same platform, the
numbers should be really close. Otherwise, you will need to calibrate
your car.

<span class="mark">We are following the standard from RC CAR world,
Channel 1 for Steering, Channel 2 for Throttle</span>

> Note:The default DonkeyCar build uses Channels 0 and 1

The UCSDRoboCar has at least two actuators. A steering servo and the DC
motor connected to an Electronics Speed Controller (ESC). These are
controlled by PWM (Pulse Width Modulation).

We use PWM Controller to generate the PWM signals, a device similar to
the one in the picture below

<img src="./10imagesfinal/media/image5.png"
style="width:4.01563in;height:2.80485in" />

Shutdown the RPI if it is on type this command

> sudo shutdown -h now

Connect the Steering Servo to the Channel 1

Connect the Throttle (ESC) to Channel 2

Observe the orientation of the 3 wires connector coming from the
Steering Servo and ESC. Look for a the black or brown wire, that is the
GND (-).

Lets run a Python command to calibrate Steering and Throttle

The donkey commands need to be run from the directory you created for
your car, i.e., <span class="mark">d2</span>

If you have not done so, SSH into the RPI

If needed, change directory to d2t

cd d2t

The output

(env) pi@jackrpi10:~/projects/d3 \$

donkey calibrate <span class="mark">--channel 1</span>

Try some values around 400 to center the steering

> Enter a PWM setting to test(100-600)370
>
> Enter a PWM setting to test(100-600)365
>
> Enter a PWM setting to test(100-600)360

<span class="mark">In my case</span>, 365 seems to center the steering

Take note of the left max, right max,

ex:

365 - Center

<span class="mark">285</span> - Steering left max

<span class="mark">440</span> - Steering right max

Note: When donkey calibrate times-out after few tries, just run it again

donkey calibrate <span class="mark">--channel 1</span>

You can interrupt the calibration by typing CTRL-C

> <span class="mark">MAKE SURE THE ROBOT IS ON THE RC CAR STAND</span>

Let me say this one more time

> <span class="mark">MAKE SURE THE ROBOT IS ON THE RC CAR STAND</span>

Now to calibrate the Throttle Electronic Speed Controller ESC (THROTTLE)

Following the standard for R/C cars. Throttle goes on channel
<span class="mark">2</span>

donkey calibrate <span class="mark">--channel 2</span>

> Enter a PWM setting to test(100-600)<span class="mark">370
> (neutral)</span>
>
> Enter a PWM setting to test(100-600)380
>
> Enter a PWM setting to test(100-600)390

370 when power up the ESC seems to be the middle point (neutral),

lets use 370 also to be compatible with Donkey.

Neutral when power the ESC - <span class="mark">370</span>

Then go in increments of 10~20 until you can no longer hear increase on
the speed

of the car. Don’t worry much about the max speed since we won’t drive
that fast autonomously

and during training the speed will be limited.

Max speed forward - <span class="mark">460</span>

Reverse on RC cars is a little tricky because the ESC needs to receive

a reverse pulse, zero pulse, and again reverse pulse to start to go
backwards.

Use the same technique as above set the PWM <span class="mark">setting
to your zero throttle (lets say 370)</span>.

> <span class="mark">Enter the reverse value</span>, then the

Neutral when power the ESC - <span class="mark">370</span>

Max speed forward - <span class="mark">460</span>

Max speed backwards - <span class="mark">280</span>

and from the steering calibration

Center - 365

Steering left max - <span class="mark">285</span>

Steering right max - <span class="mark">440</span>

---

Now let's write these values into the car configuration file

(dk)**pi@jackrpi02**:**~/projects/d3 \$** ls

> config.py **data** **logs** manage.py **models**

Edit the file config.py

> (dk)**pi@jackrpi02**:**~/projects/d3 \$**

and ESC</span> connected

...

**STEERING**

STEERING_CHANNEL = 1

STEERING_LEFT_PWM = <span class="mark">285</span>

STEERING_RIGHT_PWM = <span class="mark">440</span>

**THROTTLE**

THROTTLE_CHANNEL = <span class="mark">2</span>

THROTTLE_FORWARD_PWM = <span class="mark">460</span>

THROTTLE_STOPPED_PWM = <span class="mark">370</span>

THROTTLE_REVERSE_PWM = <span class="mark">280</span>

Also, if needed change these

**JOYSTICK**

USE_JOYSTICK_AS_DEFAULT = True

JOYSTICK_MAX_THROTTLE = 0.4

JOYSTICK_STEERING_SCALE = 1.0

AUTO_RECORD_ON_THROTTLE = True

Another example of configuration for the config.py, now with a joystick
dead zone for neutral

donkey calibrate --channel 1

donkey calibrate --channel 2

config.py settings

**STEERING**

STEERING_CHANNEL = 1

STEERING_LEFT_PWM = 275

STEERING_RIGHT_PWM = 440

Center ~ 360

**THROTTLE**

THROTTLE_CHANNEL = 2

THROTTLE_FORWARD_PWM = 460

THROTTLE_STOPPED_PWM = 370

THROTTLE_REVERSE_PWM = 220

JOYSTICK_MAX_THROTTLE = 0.8

At the UCSD Outdoor Track my car was turning too much. I scaled the
steering. May need to increase the number to have sharper turns.

JOYSTICK_STEERING_SCALE = 0.8

Because I have a particular joystick that the Throttle neutral was not
centered, I had to

use a deadzone value on config.py

Try first with deadzone= 0

JOYSTICK_DEADZONE = 0.02

**LED**

HAVE_RGB_LED = True

**board pin number for pwm outputs**

LED_PIN_R = 8

LED_PIN_G = 10

LED_PIN_B = 12

**LED status color, 0-100**

LED_R = 0

LED_G = 0

LED_B = 60

Note: If you robot has too much power or not enough power when you start
driving it, adjust the max_throttle

JOYSTICK_MAX_THROTTLE = 0.5

This also will be your starting power setting when using the constant
throttle autopilot.

Connecting the PS3 Keypad/Joystick

Bluetooth Setup

[<u>https://pythonhosted.org/triangula/sixaxis.html</u>](https://pythonhosted.org/triangula/sixaxis.html)

We need to install some bluetooth software in the RPI

ssh to the RPI

sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install bluetooth libbluetooth3 libusb-dev

sudo systemctl enable bluetooth.service

sudo usermod -G bluetooth -a pi

shutdown the RPI

Remove the power from the RPI. Wait ~ 5 s.

Power on the RPI,

Connect your PS3 Controller to the RPI using a mini USB Cable.

SSH to the RPI

Lets download, compile, and install some bluetooth configuration
software

wget http://www.pabr.org/sixlinux/sixpair.c

Yes

Type trust and the MAC address for the PS3 controller

ex: \[bluetooth\]trust 64:D4:BD:03:CD:C9

trust THE_MAC_ADDRESS_PS3_CONTROLLER

Changing 64:D4:BD:03:CD:C9 trust succeeded

> \[CHG\] Device 64:D4:BD:03:CD:C9 Trusted: yes

\[bluetooth\]quit

Agent unregistered

Lets check what input devices are available

ls /dev/input

Output

by-id by-path event0 event1 <span class="mark">js0</span> mice

you should see a <span class="mark">js0</span>

If connected by the USB cable, disconnect the PS3 controller from the
RPI.

Lets list the input devices again

ls /dev/input

Output

mice

Now press the \<PS\> button at the PS3 controller,

the lights on the front of the controller should flash for a couple of
seconds then stop

The LED 1 should then stay one or flash then goes off. Since we are not
using a PS3 game

console, the LEDS on the controller showing the connections are not
reliable.

Again, we are not connecting the PS3 controller to a PS3 game
console...). As long as you see a

js0 listed on your input devices you are good to go. See below.

ls /dev/input

Output

event0 event1 <span class="mark">js0</span> mice

Please keep your PS3 Controller Off when you are not using it. Press and
hold the \<PS\>

button for ~10s. The LEDs at the controller will flash then go off.

If the PS3 controller connection is intermittent, try

sudo rpi-update

To remove a device, lets say another JoyStick that you don’t use anymore

bluetoothctl

paired-devices

remove THE_MAC_ADDRESS

\[NEW\] Controller B8:27:EB:72:95:A6 rpimine01 \[default\]

\[NEW\] Device 00:1E:3D:D8:EA:15 PLAYSTATION(R)3 Controller

\[DEL\] Device 00:1E:3D:D8:EA:15 PLAYSTATION(R)3 Controller

Device has been removed

\[bluetooth\]

If you are having problems pairing the PS3 controller, please reset it.

There is “small” reset button at the back. Look up at the Internet if
you can’t find it.

This is another method that worked for me with the the RaspbianBuster
(Sep 2019)

<span class="mark">sudo apt-get install bluetooth libbluetooth3

<span class="mark">sudo systemctl enable bluetooth.service</span>

<span class="mark">sudo bluetoothctl</span>

<span class="mark">agent on</span>

<span class="mark">default-agent</span>

<span class="mark">scan on</span>

Plug the PS3 Controller in the RPI using a Mini USB Cable

Trust when asked

Disconnect the PS3 Controller

Press the PS Button on the Controller. See if it will pair

Now you can go drive you robot to collect data. Make sure to keep the

EMO handy and use when needed!

Also the \<X\> on your controller is like an emergency break.

Driving the Robot to Collect data

Remember you are driving at max of **x** (0.**x**) Throttle power based
on the

config.py that you edited.

To reverse you may have to reverse, stop, reverse. This is a feature of
the

ESC using on RC cars to prevent damaging gears when changing from
forward to reverse.

On the RPI

Donkey Install Using Linux - Ubuntu

It is highly recommended that you use Ubuntu in this class. Ideally you
can make your computer

dual boot to Ubuntu. Look for instructions at the Internet for that.
PLEASE backup your computer

first.

Alternatively, you can install a Virtual Machine management software.
e.g., VirtualBox.

Then install Ubuntu.

These first instructions wont have GPU support.

Nvidia GPU support documentation is provided later in this document.

Installation of GPU features won’t be supported in the class.

You will have access to a GPU Cluster from the UC San Diego
Supercomputer Center.

Lets refresh the Ubuntu repositories and installed software

sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get upgrade

First lets create a directory to store your projects

mkdir projects

cd projects

Install some necessary software and create a virtual environment

sudo apt-get install virtualenv build-essential python3-dev gfortran
libhdf5-dev libatlas-base-dev

virtualenv env -p python3

Activate the virtual environment

source env/bin/activate

Look for the <span class="mark">(env)</span> in front of your command
line. It is indication that env is active

To deactivate an environment type deactivate from inside the environment

To activate, make sure you are at the projects directory then type
source env/bin/activate

To install specific versions of Keras and Tensorflow (non-GPU)

Install Keras

pip install keras==2.2.2

Install tensorflow

pip install tensorflow==1.10.0

As 03Feb19, the latest version of tensorflow is 1.12

Keep the same version of Tensorflow as close as the Tensorflow in the
robocar

(Raspberry) as feasible.

pip install tensorflow==1.12

if needed, install keras 2.2.4

pip install keras==2.2.4

> Run a short TensorFlow program to test it
>
> Invoke python from your shell as follows:
>
> \$ python
>
> Enter the following short program inside the python interactive shell:
>
> Python
>
> import tensorflow as tf
>
> hello = tf.constant('Hello, TensorFlow!')
>
> sess = tf.Session()
>
> print(sess.run(hello))

Ctr-D gets out of the Python Tensorflow test.

Install Donkey on your Ubuntu Linux Computer

cd projects

If you want to create another virtual environment or env was not created
yet

Install some necessary software and create a virtual environment

sudo apt-get install virtualenv build-essential python3-dev gfortran
libhdf5-dev libatlas-base-dev

virtualenv env -p python3

Activate the virtual environment

source env/bin/activate

Look for the <span class="mark">(env)</span> in front of your command
line. It is indication that env is active

To deactivate an environment type deactivate from inside the environment

To activate, make sure you are at the projects directory then type
source env/bin/activate

This is like you did on RPI but I had my car under the ~/projects
directory

Lets get the latest Donkey Framework from Tawn Kramer

git clone https://github.com/tawnkramer/donkey  
pip install -e donkey\[pc\]

Create a car

donkey createcar --path ~/projects/d2t

from here you can transfer data from your RPI,and then train

create a model (autopilot), transfer the model to the RPI, test it.

Using the GPU Cluster to Train the Auto Pilots

27Aug18 - Under development - Please provide feedback

We are following the instruction provide by out IT Team

[<u>https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vTe9sehl7izNJJNypsDNABD4wg-F-AClAi0cYV3pIIRGpCknD7SEWQPEGqy_5DBRmFQtkulLkHkLxEm/pub</u>](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vTe9sehl7izNJJNypsDNABD4wg-F-AClAi0cYV3pIIRGpCknD7SEWQPEGqy_5DBRmFQtkulLkHkLxEm/pub)

We will be using the UCSD Supercomputer GPU Cluster. There are few steps
that you need to follow. Pay attention to not leave machines running on
the cluster because it is a share resource.

You should be able to log with you student credentials.

Pay attention to not use a GPU machine to do work that does not require
GPU...

To begin, login to your account using an SSH client. Most students will
use their standard email username to sign on

Create Car Project

ssh
[<u>YOUR_USER_ID@ieng6.ucsd.edu</u>](mailto:YOUR_USER_ID@ieng6.ucsd.edu)

prep me148f

We will launch a container (similar to a virtual machine) without GPU.
Tensorflow is not installed on it.

Lets launch a machine to enable us to create a robocar using the Donkey
Framework

<span class="mark">No GPU</span> to save resources

launch-py3torch.sh

> *Attempting to create job ('pod') with 4 CPU cores, 16 GB RAM, and
> <span class="mark">0 GPU units</span>.*

To keep the car name the same as in the RPI I created a d2t car

source activate /datasets/conda-envs/me148f-conda/

donkey createcar --path projects/<span class="mark">d2t</span>/

The car was created under projects

cd ~/projects/d2t

Lets exit the container you used to create the Car

exit

Lets check that we don’t have any container running under our user

kubectl get pods

> *No resources found.*

If there is nothing still running, lets get out of the ieng6 machine

logout

If you see a container still running,

f “kubectl get pods” shows leftover containers still running, you may
kill them as follows:

> \[ee148vzz@ieng6-201\]:~:505\$ <span class="mark">kubectl get
> pods</span>
>
> NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE
>
> ee148vzz-24313 1/1 Running 0 9m

>
> No resources found.
>
> \[ee148vzz@ieng6-201\]:~:508\$

If there is no container running, lets get out of the ieng6 machine

logout

Now, let’s bring some data in so we can train on it

Use rsync command below in one line

You can rsync direct from the RPI. SSH to the RPI the issue the rsync
command to rsync direct to the GPU cluster. Or you can rsync the data to
your computer then rsync to the GPU cluster

Example of rsync one particular Tub directory

rsync -avr -e ssh --rsync-path=cluster-rsync tub_1_17-11-18
<span class="mark">YOUR_USER_ID</span>@ieng6.ucsd.edu:projects/d2/data/

Example of rsync the entire data directory  
Sending data to the UCSD GPU Cluster direct from the RPI  
rsync -avr -e ssh --rsync-path=cluster-rsync ~/projects/d3/data/\*
<span class="mark">YOUR_USER_ID</span>@ieng6.ucsd.edu:projects/<span class="mark">d2</span>/data/  
  
or if you have the car created at d2t at the RPI and GPU Cluster  
  
rsync -avr -e ssh --rsync-path=cluster-rsync ~/projects/d3/data/\*
YOUR_USER_ID@ieng6.ucsd.edu:projects/<span class="mark">d2t</span>/data/

To enable constant rsync and train while you collect data (drive) we
need to exchange a key between the two computers we will rsync. e.g.,
GPU Cluster and RPI, your computer and RPI, your computer and the GPU
Cluster

To Enable Continuous Training - And to not have to type password for SSH
and RSYNC

At the PC or RPI

**Generate the Private and Public Keys**

cd ~

sudo apt-get install rsync

ssh-keygen -t rsa

You may see a warning if you already have a key in your system. Just
keep or replace it as you

wish. Keep in mind that if you replace the key your previous trust
connections will be lost.

Linux Ubuntu

cat .ssh/id_rsa.pub

macos

cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

Copy the output of the command into a buffer (e.g., Ctrl-C)

You can use two terminals to easy the copy and paste the information

Leave a terminal open with the key you generated

From your PC to the RPI

Try this first. If does not work try the steps below this line

cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub \| ssh pi@YOUR_PI_NAME.local 'cat \>\>
.ssh/authorized_keys'

or

From the PC to the RPI or PC to the Cluster

At the RPI or GPU Cluster

cd ~

mkdir .ssh

If the directory exists, just ignore this error if you see it

> \> mkdir: cannot create directory ‘.ssh’: File exists

chmod 700 .ssh

chown pi:pi .ssh

nano .ssh/authorized_keys

then copy and paste the information from the host id_rsa.pub you
generated earlier at the PC or RPI

I was able to ssh to the RPI without asking for the password

ex: ssh pi@jackrpi05.local

Here is what I have done to ssh and use rsync from my computer to the
Cluster

without having to type the user password all the time

for user me148f

SSH to ieng6

ssh me148f@ieng6.ucsd.edu

\[me148f@ieng6-201\]:~:44\$ cd ~

\[me148f@ieng6-201\]:~:45\$ mkdir .ssh

\[me148f@ieng6-201\]:~:46\$ chmod 700 .ssh

\[me148f@ieng6-201\]:~:48\$ chown me148f:me148f .ssh

Just ignore the error below

> chown: invalid group: 'me148f:me148f'

\[me148f@ieng6-201\]:~:49\$ nano .ssh/authorized_keys

Now copy and paste the Key you created on your computer.

You can use this same process to ssh / rsync from the RPI to the Cluster

without having to type the user password all the time.

Now you should be able to ssh and rsync to the RPI or Cluster without
typing the user password

ex: ssh
[<u>YOUR_USER_ID@ieng6.ucsd.edu</u>](mailto:YOUR_USER_ID@ieng6.ucsd.edu)

If you can not ssh to the RPI or Cluster, fix the problem before
continue

Constant rsync - sync data while you drive the car

Lets make rsync run periodically

We will be using some Python Code

rsync data continuously to the data directory under where the code was
called from

ex: ~/projects/d2t

From the PC to the RPI

At the PC, create a file name continous_data_rsync.py

nano continous_data_rsync.py

> import os
>
> import time
>
> while True:
>
> command = "rsync -aW --progress %s@%s:%s/data/ ./data/ --delete" %\\
>
> ('pi', 'jackrpi04.local', '~/projects/d3')
>
> os.system(command)
>
> time.sleep(5)

call the python code with

python continous_data_rsync.py

From the RPI to the GPU Cluster

Since the GPU cluster can not see your RPI on the network,

we need to RSYNC from the RPI to the GPU Cluster

At the RPI create a file name continous_data_rsync.py

nano continous_data_rsync.py

> import os
>
> import time
>
> while True:
>
> command = "rsync -aW --progress %s@%s:%s/data/ ./data/ --delete" %\\
>
> ('pi', 'jackrpi04.local', '~/projects/d3')
>
> os.system(command)
>
> time.sleep(5)

call the python code with

python continous_data_rsync.py

Continuous Train  
This command fires off the keras training in a mode where it will
continuously look for new

data at the end of every epoch.  
  
Usage:  
donkey contrain \[--tub=\<data_path\>\] \[--model=\<path to model\>\]
\[--transfer=\<path to model\>\]
\[--type=\<linear\|categorical\|rnn\|imu\|behavior\|3d\>\] \[--aug\]

example

training for a particular tub

donkey contrain --tub=~/projects/d2t/data/tub_1_18-08-20
--model=20aug18_just_testing.h5

training for all tub files

donkey contrain --model=24aug18_just_testing.h5

Continuous Training from a PC

Youetter have a GPU for training, if not this will take a long time. It
wont work.

If you don’t have a NVIDIA GPU on your PC with CUDA

Here what I have done for continuous training using a PC

For continuous training

Read instructions and do the security keys exchange first

After exchanging the security keys to not have to type the password on
ssh and RSYNC

Create a file name continous_data_rsync.py

nano continous_data_rsync.py

import os

import time

while True:

command = "rsync -aW --progress %s@%s:%s/data/ ./data/ --delete" %\\

('pi', '<span class="mark">jackrpi01</span>.local', '~/projects/d3')

os.system(command)

time.sleep(10)

To start the continuous RSYNC

python continous_data_rsync.py

Edit the config.py at your computer so the continuous training works

Continuous Training sends models to the PI when there is new model
created.

No need to have an RSYNC for models.

nano config.py

pi information

PI_USERNAME = "pi"

PI_PASSWD = "<span class="mark">Your_RPI_PassWord_Here</span>"

PI_HOSTNAME = "<span class="mark">jackrpi01.local</span>"

PI_DONKEY_ROOT = "<span class="mark">d2t</span>"

SEND_BEST_MODEL_TO_PI = True

save the config.py

Continuous Training

training for all tub files

python train.py --continuous --model=models/date_modelName.h5

training for a particular tub

python train.py --continuous
--tub=~/projects/d2t_pmm01/data/tub_1_18-08-20
--model=20aug18_just_testing.h5

If set on config.py continuous Training automatically sends the new
model to the RPI.

SEND_BEST_MODEL_TO_PI = True

When using the UCSD’s GPU Cluster, you will need an rsync for the models

since the GPU Cluster can not see the RPI

When using the GPU Cluster, rsync works from the RPI to the GPU Cluster

rsync models to the RPI continuously from the models directory where the
code was called from

Create a file name continous_models_rsync.py

nano continous_models_rsync.py

import os

import time

while True:

command = "rsync -aW --progress ./models/ %s@%s:%s/models/ --delete" %\\

('pi', '<span class="mark">jackrpi01.local</span>', '~/projects/d3')

os.system(command)

time.sleep(30)

To start the continuous RSYNC

python continous_models_rsync.py

Issue the drive command with the model name.

You need a new model name before issuing the command to drive with a
mode.

So lets create a blank model file. Use the same name for the model you
will create with

continuous training

touch ~/projects/d3/<span class="mark">24nov18_ucsd01.json</span>

Load the model_name.json because it loads faster than model_name.h5

python manage.py drive
--model=./models/<span class="mark">24nov18_ucsd01.json</span>

Security Keys Exchange

It can save you some time by allowing you log to the RPI without asking
for the password,

same for RSYNC

Dont use this on mission critical computers

At the PC

**Generate the Private and Public Keys**

**Exchange security Keys**

cd ~

sudo apt-get install rsync

ssh-keygen -t rsa

ubuntu

cat .ssh/id_rsa.pub

mac

cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

Copy the output of the command into the buffer (Ctrl-C or Command-C on a
Mac)

At the RPI

cd ~

mkdir .ssh

> Ignore this message if you get it
>
> \> mkdir: cannot create directory ‘.ssh’: File exists

chmod 700 .ssh

chown pi:pi .ssh

nano .ssh/authorized_keys

I was able to ssh to the RPI without asking for the password

ex: ssh pi@jackrpi04.local

Summary of commands after the robot built and software Installed

[<u>http://docs.donkeycar.com/guide/get_driving/</u>](http://docs.donkeycar.com/guide/get_driving/)

You will need and Access Point (AP) to connect to your RoboCar to be
able to SSH to it and give the commands:

For that we have few options:

- Move the WiFi AP to a place close to the track. You will need a power
  outlet there to power the AP

- Use your phone as an AP. You will need to add an entry in the RoboCar
  WiFi configuration so it connects to your Phone AP. See instruction on
  RPI WiFi configuration. Please make sure it has a lower priority than
  the UCSDRoboCar AP. e.g., 30 and below. Moreover, you will need to
  connect your computer to the same phone AP so you can SSH to your
  RoboCar RPI.

- You can create a direct connection between your computer and the
  RoboCar. Need to search the net for that. Please make sure the RoboCar
  still connects to the AP UCSDRoboCar after you are done using the
  direct connection with your phone.

If you follow the instructions in this document, the PS3Keypad/Joystick
will be used by default to drive the RoboCar.

Check Tub

This command allows you to see how many records are contained in any/all
tubs. It will also open each record and ensure that the data is readable
and intact. If not, it will allow you to remove corrupt records.

Usage:

<span class="mark">donkey tubcheck \<tub_path\> \[--fix\]  
</span>

- Run on the host computer or the robot

- It will print summary of record count and channels recorded for each
  tub

- It will print the records that throw an exception while reading

- The optional <span class="mark">--fix</span> will delete records that
  have problem

PS3 Controller Modes

The default mode will be that <span class="mark">User</span> is in
Control. That is, the user controls Steering and Throttle.

To switch to **<span class="mark">Local Angle</span>** (software
controls the Steering and user the Throttle), you need to press the
**\<Select\>** button in the Joystick.

If you give Throttle the Robocar should drive around semi-autonomously.

After few laps that you see that your model is good,

<span class="mark">Please hold your robot with the wheels out of the
floor</span>

you can press the **\<Start\>** button <span class="mark">and
immediately press **the \<left_DOWN_arrow\>** button few times to
decrease the Throttle as needed.</span> This is important so you slow
down the Robocar for a constant Throttle.

Press the \<left_UP_arrow\> to give it more Throttle as needed.

Pressing \<<span class="mark">X\></span> will stop the robocar and go
back to User mode (user is in control)

You can change the driving modes by pressing the **\<Select\>** button.
You should be able to see a message on your computer terminal that is
SSH connected to the RoboCar RPI.

The Local & Angle mode (fully autonomous) is to be used after you see
that you can do few laps with local angle

> Hit Select button to toggle between three modes - User, Local Angle,
> and Local Throttle & Angle.

- User - User controls both steering and throttle with joystick

- Local Angle - Ai controls steering. User controls throttle.

- Local Throttle & Angle - Ai controls both steering and throttle

> When the car is in Local Angle mode, the NN will steer. You must
> provide throttle...

Ideally you will have ~ 60 laps

If you don’t have a good working Auto-Pilot, get more data in 10 laps
increments.

In summary, you may want to start with 60 laps and then do 10~20 laps
more to see if the model gets better.

I would not worry much about few bad spots when collecting data. Drive
the car back to the track,

then press Green_Triangle to delete the last 5s of data.

Keep driving, you will develop good skills, you will get good data and
better models. If you leave the track, just drive the RoboCar back to
track. It may even learn how to get back to track.

If you keep the data from the same track (ex: UCSD Track) in the
d2t/data directory, as you add more files to it (e.g.,
tub\_<span class="mark">5</span>\_17-10-13) it will help your model. At
the same time it will take more time to train since your model will read
all the data sets in the directory. You can use transfer model to add
new data to a current model.

Incremental training using a previous model

> python train.py --tub ~/projects/d2t/data/NAME_OF_NEW_TUBE_DATA
> --transfer=models/NAME_OF_PREVIOUS_MODEL.h5
> --model=models/NAME_OF_NEW_MODEL.h5

Some Advanced Tools

The visualization tool is to be use on your PC. Please even if you can,
please do not use the GPU Cluster Resources for this.

Visualizing the model driving the car vs. human driver

Install OpenCV

sudo apt-get install python-opencv

pip3 install opencv-python

donkey makemovie --tub=data\tub_file --model=models\model_name.h5
--limit=100 --salient --scale=2

example

donkey makemovie --tub=data/tub_9_19-01-19
--model=models/19jan19_oakland_5.h5 --start 1 --end 1000 --salient

Here are installs with very limited or no support in this course.

There are too many computers and OS variations to support...

The installation on Linux(ubuntu) is much easier now using Conda

See docs.donkeycar.com

[<u>https://docs.donkeycar.com/guide/host_pc/setup_ubuntu/</u>](https://docs.donkeycar.com/guide/host_pc/setup_ubuntu/)

I will stop maintaining the installing of the donkeycar into the host

Ubuntu 18.04 - Tensorflow-GPU - CUDA Install - NVIDIA GPUs with CUDA
Cores

If your computer has a NVIDIA GPU with CUDA cores, you can take
advantage of the GPU to

accelerate the AI training. Based on the class experience, results
varies between

3~10 times faster when comparing to CPU training

Installing CUDA related files and Tensorflow GPU

If you want to try the easier way but not the latest files, we have a
compressed Zip file

with the necessary files for Linux Ubuntu 64 bits

and Tensorflow 1.12 - GPU (latest version on Feb 2019) -
cudnn-10.0-linux-x64-v7.4.1.5,

Alternatively, you can download the files from the NVIDIA site as long
as you use the same versions

for cudnn and others libraries

Or build Tensorflow from source with the version of the CUDA files you
have installed.

Building Tensorflow from source can take a few hours even on modern I7s
CPU with SSD disk and

lots of RAM...

Skip these downloads if you are using the files included in the Zipped
file listed above.

Otherwise you can get the files from the NVIDIA site

note release 10.1, adjust for 10.2 or other version you may be
installing

Now that it works, let's add the path to be persistent  
add at the end of the file ~./profile  
nano ~/.profile

Add the PATH to include cuda-10.1 ...

set PATH so it includes user's private bin if it exists

if \[ -d "\$HOME/.local/bin" \] ; then

After installing NVIDIA drivers and cuDNN or here in this same document
I have examples

[Please refer to my instructions
here](https://gist.github.com/kmhofmann/cee7c0053da8cc09d62d74a6a4c1c5e4).

Now lets install Tensorflow

If you don’t have the python3 virtual environment, create one

I am using ~/projects/envs/env1

sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install virtualenv

virtualenv --system-site-packages -p python3 ~/projects/envs/env1

Activate your virtual environment

source ~/projects/envs/env1/bin/activate

(env) jack@lnxmbp01:~/projects\$

easy_install -U pip

To install the latest version of tensorflow with GPU support, you can
use

pip3 install --upgrade tensorflow-gpu

The version on the Zipped file is already old. Left available for
testing only

(if you have new CPUs like Intel I5 and I7), you can use the tensorflow
file included

in the downloaded Zip file earlier in these instructions.

<img src="./10imagesfinal/media/image20.png"
style="width:4.35938in;height:0.45575in" />

tensorflow-1.12.0-cp36-cp36m-linux_x86_64.whl

<span class="mark">Or alternatively if you believe the released
tensorflow use the same CUDA install you have</span>

<span class="mark">running in your computer, you can use</span>

<span class="mark">pip3 install --upgrade tensorflow-gpu</span>

<span class="mark">Note on using the latest CUDA version. The packages
available at the standard repository may</span>

<span class="mark">not work with the latest CUDA such as CUDA 10</span>

<span class="mark">You need to download Tensorflow that was built for
the version of CUDA and relate</span>

<span class="mark">software you installed</span>

<span class="mark">You can install a particular version of Tensorflow
such as 1.4</span>

<span class="mark">pip3 install --upgrade tensorflow-gpu==1.4</span>

<span class="mark">or 1.3.1</span>

<span class="mark">pip3 install --upgrade tensorflow-gpu==1.3.0</span>

To install a particular Tensorflow such as the \*.whl file included at
the Zipped

file you have downloaded

use the Tensorflow file name you downloaded

pip3 install --upgrade tensorflow-1.12.0-cp36-cp36m-linux_x86_64.whl

you need to be in the same directory where the file is or specify the
complete path.

I usually copy over the tensorflow .whl file to my projects directory
and install it from there.

After a successful install

Run a short Python program to test the Tensorflow install

(env) jack@lnxmbp01:~/projects\$

python

Enter the following txt, you can cut and paste

> Python
>
> import tensorflow as tf
>
> hello = tf.constant('Hello, TensorFlow!')
>
> sess = tf.Session()
>
> print(sess.run(hello))

It worked.

How to install Tenforflow with GPU support

Note the instructions below are for an older NVIDIA GPUs. It will work
for modern NVIDIA GPUs

but it wont take advantage of the new features and all its performance

You can adapt the instructions to have the latest CUDA, cuDNN, and

Look for the <span class="mark">(env)</span> in front of your command
line. It is indication that env is active

To deactivate an environment type deactivate from inside the environment

To activate, make sure you are at the projects directory then type
source env/bin/activate
