# UCSD VESC Setup Instructions
Version 2.0 30 Dec 2022

These instructions are for different versions of the VESC &mdash; pay attention to what version you have. Choosing incorrect firmware may harm the VESC.

If the VESC is connected to the SBC, disconnect them before connecting to the VESC.

**AGAIN, THE WHEELS OF THE ROBOT WILL SPIN, PLEASE MAKE SURE THE WHEELS ARE CLEAR TO ROTATE.**
